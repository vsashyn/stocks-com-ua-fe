## IMPORTANT: Development cycle

1. Before writing any code, come up with an extremely good plan, review the plan, and then ask the user for permission to execute the plan.
2. Then PAUSE and ask the user for permission to execute the plan.
3. After you have executed the plan, run: `pnpm build`
4. To run tests: `pnpm test`
5. Never try to start a dev server or curl a local endpoint.

REMEMBER you must always come up with a plan, and get sign off from the user, BEFORE writing any code.
